# Optimization Methods

Coursework project focused on numerical optimization techniques implemented during the third year of studies at AGH University of Krakow.  
The main goal was to apply one-dimensional optimization methods to approximate higher-order dynamic systems using simplified first-order models.

All calculations and simulations were performed in **MATLAB** as part of coursework.
